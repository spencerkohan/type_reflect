# Type Reflect

*Be aware: the current status of this project is very incomplete.  I'm using it as

This library is implemented to make it easier to bridge between Rust types and Zod schemas for TypeScript.

This can be useful, for instance, in the context of a Rust Back-end service interacting with a TypeScript front-end.

Other solutions exist to solve similar problems, for instance the excellent [ts-rs crate](https://crates.io/crates/ts-rs), which I borrow from heavily, but these did not solve the specific problem I had which was to generate a Zod schema from a Rust type.

So for example, if I have this type:

```
struct Foo {
    name: String,
    id: u32,
    value: f64
}
```

This crate provides a way to automatically generate a Zod schema like so:

```
export const FooSchema = z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    id: z.number(),
    value: z.number(),
});

export type Foo = z.infer<typeof FooSchema>;
```

Toward that goal, this crate implements a procedural macro, which grants runtime type reflection to Rust types.

# Goals

This crate is opinionated.  It's intended to make it as easy as possible to make a pragmatic subset of all types expressable in Rust easily sharable with other languages, and TypeScript in particular.

The goals of this crate are:
- To provide a procedural derive macro which can make a Rust type portable to TypeScript with one line of code
- To interoperate with Serde for easy sharing of types between languages via JSON
- To give the developer control over when and where the types definitions are exported in different languages

Non-goals:
- This crate does not seek to support every rust type.  The goal is to support types which can easily be shared between languages.  If a type is not supported, the macro should fail fast with a meaningful error message.  Examples of unsupported types include:
    - Reference types (&)
    - Box, Ref, Arc, Mutex etc.
    - Basically anything which can't be easily serialzied into JSON
- This crate is not currently optimized for performance, it's optimized for productivity



## Example Usage:

Type declaration:

```
#[derive(Reflect)]
struct MyStruct {
    foo: i32,
    bar: String,
    baz: MyOtherType
}


export_types!(
    types: [
        MyStruct,
        MyOtherType,
    ]
    exports: [
        Rust("/export/dir/1", "/export/dir/2"),
        Zod("/export/dir/3"),
        MyCustomExport("/export/dir/4")
    ]
)
```

Where `export_types` desugars to:

```
let export_dir1 = "/export/dir/1"
remove_file(export_dir1)

export_dir1.write_all(MyStruct::export<Zod>())
export_dir1.write_all(MyOtherType::export<Zod>())

...
```

## Example Transformations

Enums are transformed by default to unions, with the `_case` field used to differntiate the cases.

So for instance this enum:

```
enum Foo {
    Bar,
    Baz
}
```

ToDo:

- [x] Basic end-to-end
    - [x] Parsing types implemented
    - [x] Export function working
- [x] Support for complex types in TS/zod export
    - [x] Option
    - [x] Array
    - [x] Map
- [x] Support for Rust export
- [x] Support for Enums
- [ ] Coordinate with Serde attributes
    - [ ] Throw a validation error if the incorrect attributes are applied


Problems:
Currently this implementation assumes the following:
- The attributes #[serde(tag="_case", content="data"] are applied
